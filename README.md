# ECE535-Smart-Doorbell-using-Raspberry-Pi-and-ML

# Motivation
A Smart Doorbell would create a safe and convenient system that can identify visitors and provide useful alerts without relying on heavy cloud infrastructure.

# Design Goals
We want to deploy ML systems on the Raspberry Pi with a camera module to design a smart doorbell that can detect people and classify whether they are recognized (e.g., known household members) or unknown. 

# Deliverables
• Learn how to deploy ML models on Raspberry Pi
• Implement a lightweight face detection or person detection model using TensorFlow Lite.
• Build a simple system that, when someone appears at the door, captures an image and classify
• The final output should be a code snippet and demonstration running inference directly on Raspberry Pi
